# Road To TypeScript

This book was created to help [Flow](https://flow.org/) users transition to TypeScript. It is divided into two sections. The Flow Equivalence section presents a comparison between common Flow types and their TypeScript equivalent, and the Advanced Use Cases section shows how TypeScript can be used to improve error checking.
